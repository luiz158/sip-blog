  <div class="entry-content"><h3>The punch line</h3>


<p>First, here&rsquo;s the punch line for readers who already know what a circuit breaker is:</p>

<pre style="margin:20px 0;">
@Service
@Transactional(
    propagation = Propagation.REQUIRED,
    isolation = Isolation.DEFAULT,
    readOnly = true)
public class MessageServiceImpl implements MessageService {
    @Inject private MessageDao messageDao;

    @GuardedByCircuitBreaker("messageServiceBreaker")
    public Message getMotd() {
        return messageDao.getMotd();
    }

    @GuardedByCircuitBreaker("messageServiceBreaker")
    public List getImportantMessages() {
        return messageDao.getImportantMessages();
    }
}
</pre>


<p>If you find that exciting (or at least interesting, if you don&rsquo;t know about circuit breakers yet), read on&hellip;</p>

<h3>A proper introduction</h3>


<p>One of my favorite books is Michael Nygard&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/mnee/release-it">Release It!</a> (Pragmatic). The idea behind the book is that when we build apps, the feature set isn&rsquo;t the only thing that matters. We need to pay attention to app vulnerabilities that too often result in performance issues or else downtime. A central thesis is that plenty of vulnerabilities are sufficiently common to warrant being classified as antipatterns, and there are corresponding patterns of correct engineering practice to address the antipatterns.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at one of Nygard&rsquo;s antipatterns, the cascading failure.</p>

<h3>Cascading failures</h3>


<p>Probably everybody has seen cascading failures. It&rsquo;s essentially vertical fault propagation. The system has a fault somewhere low in the stack and the fault travels up the stack in an uncontrolled fashion until the outage is much worse than it should have been. Consider for instance the following system:</p>

<p><img src="http://springinpractice.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/portal.png" alt="Portal" /></p>

<p>In this system we have a portal home page that depends upon a web service to deliver important messages to end users. The web service in turn pulls messages out of a database. Standard stuff.</p>

<p>Now suppose there&rsquo;s some kind of problem with the database. Maybe a missing index leads to a bad execution plan, which leads to slow query times, leading to the web service&rsquo;s database calls queuing up and exhausting threads, causing the portal&rsquo;s calls to the web service to do the same thing, causing the browser&rsquo;s calls to the portal to do the same. Here&rsquo;s what that looks like:</p>

<p><img src="http://springinpractice.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/portal-cascade.png" alt="Broken portal" /></p>

<p>While it goes without saying that the important messages are important, it&rsquo;s doubtful that they&rsquo;re so important that a missing index should be allowed to create complete system unavailability. (In this example, we took out a portal home page, so nobody can get in. If users are using other apps in the portal then they can continue to use them, but nobody new can enter.)</p>

<p>Not good. But probably pretty common. I know I&rsquo;ve seen my fair share.</p>

<h3>Circuit breakers to the rescue</h3>


<p>A nice way to deal with cascading failures is to engineer the integration points to stop propagating failure. The pattern is called the circuit breaker, and it&rsquo;s modeled after physical circuit breakers in the real world. We install a circuit breaker at each integration point we want to treat. Under normal conditions, requests and responses flow over the breaker just like current flows over a real circuit breaker. But when the breaker detects a problem with the service at the far end of the breaker, it trips, thus preventing requests and responses from crossing over the integration point, at least until the breaker is reset.</p>

<p>The circuit breaker pattern has two major benefits:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Breakers protect the client:</b> We don&#8217;t want breakers wasting valuable resources (e.g., threads, network connections, their associated physical resources) calling services that are known to be down. Especially since the antipattern normally involves the thread just sitting there waiting for a response. The breaker prevents this by failing fast.</li>
    <li><b>Breakers protect the service:</b> Sometimes the service is bogging down just due to insufficient capacity. In that situation, breakers prevent a capacity issue from becoming complete service unavailability by throttling load to the service. (There&#8217;s still an availability issue here, but it&#8217;s partial.)</li>
</ul>


<p>That&rsquo;s the concept. From a technical perspective, a breaker is a state machine with three states:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Closed:</b> The breaker&#8217;s normal state. Requests and responses flow freely across the integration point.</li>
    <li><b>Open:</b> The breaker&#8217;s state when there&#8217;s a problem. No requests can make it across the integration point. In effect, problems with the service are contained, and no propagation occurs.</li>
    <li><b>Half-open:</b> The breaker&#8217;s state when it decides it&#8217;s time to &#8220;try again&#8221;. The breaker doesn&#8217;t stay open forever. Periodically it will allow a single request through to see whether the service is working again. If so, the breaker resets (goes closed). Otherwise the breaker trips again (goes open).</li>
</ul>


<p>Here&rsquo;s a state transition diagram for a circuit breaker. This is adapted from a diagram in Nygard&rsquo;s book:</p>

<p><img src="http://kite.s3.amazonaws.com/wiki/images/circuit-breaker-state-transition.png" alt="Circuit breaker state transition diagram" /></p>

<p>From the diagram we can see that the trip condition is a certain number of consecutive exceptions. In principle we could use whatever trip condition we like. For example, it could be too many exceptions within a specified time window (i.e. excessive exception rate), too many SLA misses, or perhaps something else. In the implementation we&rsquo;ll describe below it&rsquo;s too many consecutive exceptions of specific types. In general we want to filter out exceptions that the user can intentionally generate (for example, by manipulating HTTP parameters or path variables in a URL) because we don&rsquo;t want to create a vector for DoS attacks.</p>

<p>The other thing the diagram reveals is a timeout parameter. This is just the amount of time the breaker should remain open before going half-open and trying the service again.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s how breakers work in the abstract. Now let&rsquo;s look at a specific implementation based on Spring.</p>

<h3>My circuit breaker implementation</h3>


<p>My circuit breaker implementation is part of a nascent open source effort called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/kite-lib/">Kite</a> that I started a few months back. I haven&rsquo;t done terribly much with the project yet, mostly because I&rsquo;m trying to get the book wrapped up, but once I get above water again I&rsquo;ll be returning to the effort. Fortunately though I was able to get a fairly robust circuit breaker implementation out there with some useful features.</p>

<p>The breaker is based on Spring, and that being the case, it&rsquo;s code-level design is very Spring-like. It&rsquo;s pretty similar to transaction management in Spring. You configure some doodads in the application context file and then you have the choice between programmatic application of breakers (via templates; again, very similar to other templates like JdbcTemplate) or else declarative configuration. The declarative approach further supports XML-based configuration and annotation-based configuration.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at each in turn.</p>

<h4>Programmatic circuit breakers</h4>


<p>This will be familiar to anybody who has used HibernateTemplate, JdbcTemplate, TransactionTemplate, etc. The following is an example of what a Spring Web MVC controller might look like when using programmatic circuit breakers:</p>

<pre style="margin:20px 0;">
@Inject MessageService messageService;
@Inject CircuitBreakerTemplate breaker;
...

public String getMotd() {
    ...
    try {
        Message motd = breaker.execute(new CircuitBreakerCallback() {
            public Message doInCircuitBreaker() throws Exception {
                return messageService.getMotd();
            }
        });
        model.addAttribute("motd", motd);
    } catch (Exception e) {
        log.error("Couldn't get MOTD: {}", e.getMessage());
    }
    ...
}
</pre>


<p>While it&rsquo;s nice to have the flexibility to go programmatic, usually we don&rsquo;t want to go through all that trouble. The next pair of approaches simplifies things quite a bit.</p>

<h4>Declarative circuit breakers using XML</h4>


<p>Spring of course offers XML-based configuration for its various frameworks, and since Spring 2.0, Spring has supported custom namespaces that effectively let framework designers design a domain-specific language for framework configuration. That feature is too cool to pass up, so I built that into my implementation. Here&rsquo;s what the app context config looks like:</p>

<pre style="margin:20px 0;">
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;beans:beans xmlns="http://springinpractice.com/schema/kite"
    xmlns:aop="http://www.springframework.org/schema/aop"
    xmlns:beans="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
    xmlns:context="http://www.springframework.org/schema/context"
    xmlns:p="http://www.springframework.org/schema/p"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/aop
        http://www.springframework.org/schema/aop/spring-aop-3.0.xsd
        http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
        http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-3.0.xsd
        http://www.springframework.org/schema/context
        http://www.springframework.org/schema/context/spring-context-3.0.xsd
        http://springinpractice.com/schema/kite
        http:// ... kite schema location ... "&gt;

    &lt;context:mbean-export /&gt;
    
    &lt;circuit-breaker
        id="messageServiceBreaker"
        exceptionThreshold="3"
        timeout="30000" /&gt;

    &lt;circuit-breaker-advice
        id="messageServiceBreakerAdvice"
        breaker="messageServiceBreaker" /&gt;

    &lt;aop:config&gt;
        &lt;aop:pointcut id="messageServicePointcut"
            expression="execution(* kite.sample02.service.MessageServiceImpl.*(..))" /&gt;
        &lt;aop:advisor advice-ref="messageServiceBreakerAdvice"
            pointcut-ref="messageServicePointcut"
            order="0" /&gt;
    &lt;/aop:config&gt;
&lt;/beans:beans&gt;
</pre>


<p>In this configuration you can see that I&rsquo;ve made <code>kite</code> the default namespace, and then I&rsquo;ve done a bunch of config that&rsquo;s hopefully mostly self-explanatory, if you know AOP anyway. (If not, that&rsquo;s fine. Read on.) The <code>&lt;context:mbean-export /&gt;</code> is there because the breaker implementation is JMX-enabled so your NOC or support staff (maybe it&rsquo;s you) can manually trip and reset the breaker as needed. That&rsquo;s a must-have feature in my opinion. Then I define a breaker, an AOP advice for the breaker, and then a pointcut and advisor to apply the breaker to the desired location.</p>

<p>This is a nice approach, especially if you&rsquo;re not a big fan of annotations, which a lot of people aren&rsquo;t. I however like annotations quite a bit, so I went ahead and implemented support for annotation-based configuration too, as described below.</p>

<h4>Declarative circuit breakers using annotations</h4>


<p>Here&rsquo;s the app context:</p>

<pre style="margin:20px 0;">
&lt;beans:beans xmlns="http://springinpractice.com/schema/kite"
    xmlns:beans="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
    xmlns:context="http://www.springframework.org/schema/context"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
        http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-3.0.xsd
        http://www.springframework.org/schema/context
        http://www.springframework.org/schema/context/spring-context-3.0.xsd
        http://springinpractice.com/schema/kite
        http:// ... kite schema location ... "&gt;

    &lt;context:mbean-export /&gt;

    &lt;circuit-breaker
        id="messageServiceBreaker"
        exceptionThreshold="3"
        timeout="30000" /&gt;
    
    &lt;annotation-config order="0" /&gt;
&lt;/beans:beans&gt;
</pre>


<p>And here&rsquo;s the annotated service bean:</p>

<pre style="margin:20px 0;">
package kite.sample03.service;

import java.util.List;
import javax.inject.Inject;
import kite.annotation.GuardedByCircuitBreaker;
import kite.sample03.dao.MessageDao;
import kite.sample03.model.Message;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;
import org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Isolation;
import org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Propagation;
import org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Transactional;

@Service
@Transactional(
    propagation = Propagation.REQUIRED,
    isolation = Isolation.DEFAULT,
    readOnly = true)
public class MessageServiceImpl implements MessageService {
    @Inject private MessageDao messageDao;

    @GuardedByCircuitBreaker("messageServiceBreaker")
    public Message getMotd() {
        return messageDao.getMotd();
    }

    @GuardedByCircuitBreaker("messageServiceBreaker")
    public List getImportantMessages() {
        return messageDao.getImportantMessages();
    }
}
</pre>


<p>Nice and clean Spring-style annotation-based configuration.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>


<p>Hope you enjoyed the post. If you want to give it a try, go to the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/kite-lib/">Kite project</a> and try it out. Also, chapter 14 in my book <a href="http://www.manning.com/wheeler/">Spring in Practice</a> shows how to go about implementing your own Spring-style framework code, should you get the itch, and it&rsquo;s based on the circuit breaker implementation we just described. It explains how to implement a template, a custom namespace, JMX support, AOP-based configuration and also annotation-based configuration.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In preparation for a <a href="http://refcardz.dzone.com/refcardz/expression-based-authorization?oid=hom25493">DZone Refcard on Spring Security 3</a> I&rsquo;m doing, here are the Spring Security database schemas for MySQL.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t intended to be an exhaustive treatment. Rather it&rsquo;s more a reference for the MySQL dialect version of the database schemas, though I included a few brief notes just to help people get a high-level understanding of the schemas. For more detailed information, please consult the <a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring-security/site/reference.html">Spring Security 3 Reference Documentation</a>.</p>

<h3>User schema</h3>


<p><img src="http://springinpractice.s3.amazonaws.com/springsecurity/dbschemas/users_erd.png" alt="User schema ERD" /></p>

<p>Each user can have zero or more &ldquo;authorities&rdquo;, or roles. I think Spring Security expects there to be at least one role, though, because login involving roleless users fail.</p>

<pre>create table users (
    username varchar(50) not null primary key,
    password varchar(50) not null,
    enabled boolean not null
) engine = InnoDb;

create table authorities (
    username varchar(50) not null,
    authority varchar(50) not null,
    foreign key (username) references users (username),
    unique index authorities_idx_1 (username, authority)
) engine = InnoDb;
</pre>




<h3 style="margin-top:20px;">Group schema</h3>


<p>The group schema provides a way to organize users into groups and then assign roles to those groups. Each user inherits the roles from his associated groups.</p>

<p><img src="http://springinpractice.s3.amazonaws.com/springsecurity/dbschemas/groups_erd.png" alt="Group schema ERD" /></p>

<pre>create table groups (
    id bigint unsigned not null auto_increment primary key,
    group_name varchar(50) not null
) engine = InnoDb;

create table group_authorities (
    group_id bigint unsigned not null,
    authority varchar(50) not null,
    foreign key (group_id) references groups (id)
) engine = InnoDb;

create table group_members (
    id bigint unsigned not null auto_increment primary key,
    username varchar(50) not null,
    group_id bigint unsigned not null,
    foreign key (group_id) references groups (id)
) engine = InnoDb;

</pre>




<h3 style="margin-top:20px;">Remember-me schema</h3>


<p>Haven&rsquo;t actually used this one, but from what I understand, this schema supports a hardened, persistent remember-me authentication scheme. Spring Security&rsquo;s default remember-me scheme doesn&rsquo;t use the database at all (just a cookie).</p>

<p><img src="http://springinpractice.s3.amazonaws.com/springsecurity/dbschemas/remember_erd.png" alt="Remember-me schema ERD" /></p>

<pre>create table persistent_logins (
    username varchar(64) not null,
    series varchar(64) primary key,
    token varchar(64) not null,
    last_used timestamp not null
) engine = InnoDb;

</pre>




<h3 style="margin-top:20px;">ACL schema</h3>


<p>Access control lists (ACLs) might be the most challenging aspect of Spring Security, but the underlying schema is actually pretty straightforward. The concept is that each secure domain object has an associated ACL that defines who can do what with that domain object. Exactly the same idea as permissions on an OS folder, for example.</p>

<p>The SID (&ldquo;security identity&rdquo;) represents the &ldquo;who&rdquo;, and comes in both principal and role flavors; that is, the SID can be either an individual user or else it can be a role. The class and object identity, taken together, represent the domain object. Finally, the <code>acl_entry</code> table contains all the ACLs; each access control entry (ACE) specifies an ordered triple &lt;domain object, SID, permission&gt; and indicates whether the permission in question is granted or denied for the SID and domain object. To take an example, SID Ben might have the write permission granted for a particular forum message.</p>

<p><img src="http://springinpractice.s3.amazonaws.com/springsecurity/dbschemas/acl_erd.png" alt="ACL schema ERD" /></p>

<pre>create table acl_sid (
    id bigint unsigned not null auto_increment primary key,
    principal tinyint(1) not null,
    sid varchar(100) not null,
    unique index acl_sid_idx_1 (sid, principal)
) engine = InnoDb;

create table acl_class (
    id bigint unsigned not null auto_increment primary key,
    class varchar(100) unique not null
) engine = InnoDb;

create table acl_object_identity (
    id bigint unsigned not null auto_increment primary key,
    object_id_class bigint unsigned not null,
    object_id_identity bigint unsigned not null,
    parent_object bigint unsigned,
    owner_sid bigint unsigned,
    entries_inheriting tinyint(1) not null,
    unique index acl_object_identity_idx_1
        (object_id_class, object_id_identity),
    foreign key (object_id_class) references acl_class (id),
    foreign key (parent_object) references acl_object_identity (id),
    foreign key (owner_sid) references acl_sid (id)
) engine = InnoDb;

create table acl_entry (
    id bigint unsigned not null auto_increment primary key,
    acl_object_identity bigint unsigned not null,
    ace_order int unsigned not null,
    sid bigint unsigned not null,
    mask int not null,
    granting tinyint(1) not null,
    audit_success tinyint(1) not null,
    audit_failure tinyint(1) not null,
    unique index acl_entry_idx_1 (acl_object_identity, ace_order),
    foreign key (acl_object_identity)
        references acl_object_identity (id),
    foreign key (sid) references acl_sid (id)
) engine = InnoDb;</pre>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/mnee/release-it">Release It!</a>, Michael Nygard explains that a key approach to managing capacity is to balance the capacity of your front-end servers (e.g.,web servers or app servers) with that of your back-end servers. In this brief article we&rsquo;re going to look at what that means and why it&rsquo;s such a good idea to pay attention to this aspect of capacity management.</p>

<h3>A simple example of wasted capacity</h3>


<p>For the sake of example, let&rsquo;s say that we need to design an application that can support up to 100,000 concurrent user sessions within some given response time SLA. The app domain is such that we can partition the user population and employ a horizontally-scalable, sharded design. When there are problems, we want to try to limit the impact to at most 10% of the users. So we decide to go with ten pools that can handle 10,000 concurrent user sessions each. Each pool will have some number of application servers and some number of database servers.</p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t know the number of app and database servers required, but we guess that we&rsquo;re going to need twice as many app servers as database servers. So we try stress testing various pools with that server ratio. Our stress testing reveals that a 6:3 pool can&rsquo;t handle the necessary load but an 8:4 pool can. It&rsquo;s important to us to have fault tolerance, so we decide to add one app node and one database node to the pool. That gives us a 9:5 pool ratio, for a total of 90 app servers and 50 database servers, or 140 servers in all as seen in figure 1:</p>

<p><img src="http://wheelersoftware.s3.amazonaws.com/articles/balancing-server-capacity/pools.jpg" alt="Figure 1. Server pools" /></p>

<p>So what do you think?</p>

<h3>Improving the utilization of server capacity</h3>


<p>It may seem like we did a good job with this. After all, we defined our load requirements, defined a goal around limiting the impact of outages, created a horizontally scalable design to support the requirements, and then performed stress testing to ensure that our individual pools can handle the required load. So our system ought to be able to meet the stated requirements. But could we have done better?</p>

<p>You may have noticed that in our stress testing of individual pools, we began with an assumption that we&rsquo;d need twice as many app servers as database servers, but we never actually tested that assumption. Let&rsquo;s say that we repeat our stress testing and discover that even though a 8:4 ratio handles the load, stress-induced failure lies squarely with the database side of the pool. When the pool &ldquo;fails&rdquo; (e.g., stops meeting whatever response time SLA we defined),database server CPU is at 90-95% and app server CPU is humming along at 45%. Through further stress testing we discover that we can reduce the ratio to 5:4 while still meeting the overall requirement to service 10,000 concurrent user sessions within the SLA. We still want to be fault-tolerant, so we revise our pool ratio to 6:5, giving us 60 app servers and 50 database servers, or 110 servers total. That&rsquo;s a savings of 30 servers over our previous configuration,or 21.4%, and we get it without having to give anything up. Not bad, except for our hardware vendor!</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going on. In the first configuration, each pool had three app servers too many. This represents excess capacity in the system. But&mdash;and this is an important point that&rsquo;s easy to miss&mdash; it isn&rsquo;t excess capacity that would allow us to service additional user load. It&rsquo;s inherently unusable capacity. This is because the database tier breaks well before we use that extra app server capacity. So that extra capacity is pure waste. It incurs extra cost (initial purchase price along with operational costs like support, maintenance, rackspace, power,cooling, etc.) and it increases the overall complexity of the system simply by representing additional moving parts that can break or cause (sometimes hard-to-diagnose) problems.</p>

<p>The point bears repeating that the excess capacity is not usable, so it isn&rsquo;t correct to argue that it helps us if our user base grows. We can&rsquo;t tap into it, so it doesn&rsquo;t help. Anyway, the point of the horizontally scalable design here is to support adding capacity by adding pools rather than by growing individual pools.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>


<p>The bottom line is that proper capacity management involves balancing the capacity of front-end servers with that of the back-end servers. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that the number of app servers needs to be the same as the number of database servers; rather it means that we want the set of app servers and the set of database servers to converge toward failure roughly together. Any systematic delta between the two represents unusable excess capacity and hence undue waste and moving parts.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In this tutorial we&rsquo;re going to learn how to get started with Hibernate Validator, which as its name suggests is a validation framework associated with the Hibernate project. This article is really a follow-up to <a href="http://springinpractice.com/2008/07/17/annotation-based-validation-with-the-spring-bean-validation-framework/">my earlier article on using the Bean Validation Framework</a> (part of the larger <a href="https://springmodules.dev.java.net/">Spring Modules</a> project), which is a competing framework that seems to have lost the battle for Spring&rsquo;s &ldquo;preferred validation provider&rdquo; status to Hibernate Validator. Both Uri Boness (in an e-mail correspondence) and Juergen Hoeller (at SpringOne) agreed that people should start moving toward Hibernate Validator since that will eventually support the emerging <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=303">JSR 303</a> standard.</p>

<p>Hibernate Validator is nice because it (like the Bean Validation Framework) supports declarative validation via <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/annotations.html">Java 5 annotations</a>. Let&rsquo;s say you create a bean class, like an <code>Account</code> or a <code>PurchaseOrder</code> or whatever. With Hibernate Validator you can attach validation annotations to the bean properties and that will define the validation constraints for the bean. Moreover, unlike earlier approaches to validation (such as Struts Validation), Hibernate Validator isn&rsquo;t tied to the web tier, and so if you want to validate your beans from within your service beans, or within your DAOs, or even just before you ORM them into your database, no sweat. You can do just that.</p>

<p>Anyway, for now we&rsquo;re just going to look at some of the basics: how to specify annotation constraints and how to check for constraint violations. We&rsquo;re not going to worry about integrating Hibernate Validator with Spring&rsquo;s native validation framework (so that, for instance, we might render Hibernate Validator error messages out using Spring Web MVC taglibs) though I&rsquo;ll probably write another article on that sometime in the future if people are interested.</p></p>

<p>For this article we&rsquo;re using Java 5 or higher (we need Java 5 annotations) and Hibernate Validator 3.1.0. For your convenience I&rsquo;ve created a <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven 2</a> project that you can download: <a href="http://wheelersoftware.s3.amazonaws.com/articles/hibernate-validator/hibernate-validator-demo.zip">hibernate-validator-demo.zip</a></p>

<p>OK, let&rsquo;s jump into some examples of annotated bean classes.</p>

<h3>Specifying validation constraints with Hibernate Validator annotations</h3>


<p>Here are a couple of examples of annotated bean classes: a <code>User</code> class and an <code>Address</code> class. Note that the two objects are related in a parent-child fashion.</p>

<p>First, here is the <code>User</code> bean class:</p>

<pre>package com.wheelersoftware.demos.hibernatevalidator;

import org.hibernate.validator.Email;
import org.hibernate.validator.Length;
import org.hibernate.validator.NotEmpty;
import org.hibernate.validator.Valid;

public class User {
    private String username;
    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;
    private Address address;
    private String email;
    private String password;

    @NotEmpty
    @Length(max = 20)
    public String getUsername() { return username; }

    public void setUsername(String username) {
        this.username = username;
    }

    @NotEmpty
    @Length(max = 20)
    public String getFirstName() { return firstName; }

    public void setFirstName(String firstName) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
    }

    @NotEmpty
    @Length(max = 20)
    public String getLastName() { return lastName; }

    public void setLastName(String lastName) {
        this.lastName = lastName;
    }

    @Valid
    public Address getAddress() { return address; }

    public void setAddress(Address address) {
        this.address = address;
    }

    @NotEmpty
    @Email
    public String getEmail() { return email; }

    public void setEmail(String email) {
        this.email = email;
    }

    @NotEmpty
    @Length(max = 20)
    public String getPassword() { return password; }

    public void setPassword(String password) {
        this.password = password;
    }
}</pre>


<p>Let&rsquo;s talk a little about what&rsquo;s going on with the code above. As we noted earlier, we have a bean class (here, a class that represents user accounts of some sort) and we&rsquo;re using annotations to specify validation constraints. For a full list of the built-in constraints, see the <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/hib_docs/validator/reference/en/html/validator-defineconstraints.html#validator-defineconstraints-builtin">official Hibernate Validator documentation</a>, but we&rsquo;ll just focus on a small handful for right now.</p>

<p>First notice that we&rsquo;ve attached our annotations to the getter methods. This is how we specify the validation constraints that attach to the associated properties.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve used <code>@NotEmpty</code> in several places. This annotation means that the annotated property can&rsquo;t be null and it can&rsquo;t be the empty string either. There&rsquo;s also a <code>@NotNull</code> annotation that we could have used if we&rsquo;d wanted to, but in this case I wanted to prevent the empty string from being used as values.</p>

<p>Another annotation that appears multiple times is the <code>@Length</code> annotation. We can specify associated minimum and maximum lengths by using the <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> elements, respectively, though in the example above we&rsquo;ve specified only maximum lengths. (In the example that follows we&rsquo;ll see how to specify a minimum length as well.) So for example we&rsquo;ve specified that passwords can&rsquo;t be any longer than 20 characters.</p>

<p>A third annotation is the <code>@Email</code> annotation. As you would guess, this indicates that the property must contain a valid e-mail address.</p>

<p>The fourth and final annotation of the ones that appear above is the <code>@Valid</code> annotation. This tells Hibernate Validator that it should validate the associated object&mdash;here an associated <code>Address</code> object&mdash;using whatever validation annotations we define on the <code>Address</code> class.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s our segue into our second example, the <code>Address</code> bean class, which appears below.</p>

<pre>package com.wheelersoftware.demos.hibernatevalidator;

import org.hibernate.validator.Length;
import org.hibernate.validator.NotEmpty;
import org.hibernate.validator.Pattern;

public class Address {
    private String street1;
    private String street2;
    private String city;
    private String state;
    private String zip;

    @NotEmpty
    @Length(max = 40)
    public String getStreet1() { return street1; }

    public void setStreet1(String street1) {
        this.street1 = street1;
    }

    // No validation constraints
    public String getStreet2() { return street2; }

    public void setStreet2(String street2) {
        this.street2 = street2;
    }

    @NotEmpty
    @Length(max = 40)
    public String getCity() { return city; }

    public void setCity(String city) {
        this.city = city;
    }

    @NotEmpty
    @Length(max = 3)
    public String getState() { return state; }

    public void setState(String state) {
        this.state = state;
    }

    @NotEmpty
    @Length(min = 5, max = 5, message = "{zip.length}")
    @Pattern(regex = "[0-9]+")
    public String getZip() { return zip; }

    public void setZip(String zip) {
        this.zip = zip;
    }
}</pre>


<p>Our validation annotations for <code>Address</code> are pretty similar to what we saw for <code>User</code>, but there are a few differences worth mentioning. First, notice that we don&rsquo;t have to attach validation constraints to every property. It&rsquo;s OK, for example, for <code>street2</code> to be null or anything else, so we simply refrain from defining validation constraints for this property.</p>

<p>Second, we&rsquo;re using a <code>@Pattern</code> annotation for the <code>zip</code> property. This allows us to specify regular expression match patterns.</p>

<p>The third and final difference is the <code>@Length</code> annotation we&rsquo;ve defined for the <code>zip</code> property. Besides including a <code>min</code> element (which, when combined with the <code>max</code> element, indicates that the ZIP code must be exactly five characters long), we&rsquo;ve also included a <code>message</code> element. We can use this element to do either of two things. First, we can use it to define a hardcoded message to display when the given validation constraint fails. That&rsquo;s not what we&rsquo;re doing here. Instead we&rsquo;re doing the second thing we can do, which is specify a message key using the brace syntax: <code>message = {key_name}</code>. The idea is that we&rsquo;ll eventually use this message key to look up a message in a resource bundle, thus externalizing the message. Later in the tutorial we&rsquo;ll map the <code>zip.length</code> message key to an actual message using a resource bundle.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for the validation constraints themselves. Now let&rsquo;s see how we can tell Hibernate Validator to use them to perform our bean validation.</p>

<h3>How to tell Hibernate Validator to validate annotated beans</h3>


<p>It&rsquo;s fairly straightforward to get Hibernate Validator to validate our annotated beans. The following listing presents some demo code for doing exactly this. Let&rsquo;s take a look.</p>

<pre>package com.wheelersoftware.demos.hibernatevalidator;

import org.hibernate.validator.ClassValidator;
import org.hibernate.validator.InvalidValue;

public final class Demo {
    private static ClassValidator&lt;User&gt;
        userValidator = new ClassValidator&lt;User&gt;(User.class);

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        validateUser(createUser());
    }

    private static User createUser() {
        User user = new User();
        user.setFirstName("123456789012345678901");
        user.setEmail("aol.com");

        Address addr = new Address();
        addr.setStreet1("");
        addr.setCity("Moreno Valley");
        addr.setState("CA");
        addr.setZip("QWERTY");
        user.setAddress(addr);

        return user;
    }

    private static void validateUser(User user) {
        InvalidValue[] invalidValues = userValidator.getInvalidValues(user);
        for (InvalidValue value : invalidValues) {
            System.out.println("========");
            System.out.println(value);
            System.out.println("message=" + value.getMessage());
            System.out.println("propertyName=" + value.getPropertyName());
            System.out.println("propertyPath=" + value.getPropertyPath());
            System.out.println("value=" + value.getValue());
        }
    }
}</pre>


<p>There are really only a few interesting things happening here. First, we create a <code>ClassValidator&lt;User&gt;</code> instance for validating our <code>User</code> beans. We have to associate the <code>ClassValidator</code> with a type (here, <code>User</code>) because this is where Hibernate Validator goes in and reads all the annotations off of the bean class in question.</p>

<p>Next, we have to create the bean we want to validate. Usually this would come from a user form (for example, a web-based form, or maybe a Swing-based form) though that&rsquo;s not necessarily the case. Here we just create a bean manually, and we intentionally make a lot of the fields invalid so we can see how Hibernate Validator responds.</p>

<p>Finally we make the call <code>userValidator.getInvalidValues(user)</code>. This generates an array of <code>InvalidValue</code> instances&mdash;one for each validation constraint violation. Let&rsquo;s examine the <code>InvalidValue</code> class in more detail.</p>

<h3>Understanding InvalidValue</h3>


<p>To understand <code>InvalidValue</code> it will help to run the demo. So do that right now. You should see output that looks something like this:</p>

<pre>26 [main] INFO org.hibernate.validator.Version - Hibernate Validator 3.1.0.GA
45 [main] INFO org.hibernate.annotations.common.Version - Hibernate Commons Annotations 3.1.0.GA
========

========

message=length must be between 0 and 20
propertyName=firstName
propertyPath=firstName

========
lastName may not be null or empty
message=may not be null or empty

propertyPath=address.zip
value=QWERTY
========
zip must match "[0-9]+"
message=must match "[0-9]+"
propertyName=zip
propertyPath=address.zip
value=QWERTY</pre>


<p>If you look at the source code for <code>Demo.validateUser()</code> you&rsquo;ll see that we&rsquo;re printing out each <code>InvalidValue</code> instance itself (the first line) as well as the values of the <code>message</code>, <code>propertyName</code>, <code>propertyPath</code> and <code>value</code> properties (the rest of the lines). When we print out the instance itself, we get Hibernate Validator&rsquo;s attempt at a user-friendly validation eror message. It starts with the property name and then appends the message; examples include</p>

<ul class="square">
<li><code>email not a well-formed e-mail address</code></li>
<li><code>password may not be null or empty</code></li>
<li><code>zip must match "[0-9]+"</code></li>
</ul>


<p>Each <code>message</code> value (such as <code>may not be null or empty</code>) is a default associated with a validation annotation (such as <code>@NotEmpty</code>). Note that in the case of the length violation for the <code>zip</code> property, we&rsquo;re seeing not the default length message, but instead the new message key name (namely, <code>zip.length</code>) we specified in listing 2. We&rsquo;ll see how to map <code>zip.length</code> to an actual message using a resource bundle in a little bit. For now we&rsquo;re seeing just the key name because we haven&rsquo;t yet associated a message with the key.</p>

<p>The <code>propertyName</code> property specifies the name of the bean property whose value is invalid. For example, if we provide a bad ZIP code, then <code>propertyName</code> is <code>zip</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>propertyPath</code> property is similar to <code>propertyName</code> property, except that with <code>propertyPath</code> we get to see the path from the top-level bean down to the invalid property. You can see the difference, for instance, with the invalid ZIP code: <code>propertyName</code> is <code>zip</code> but <code>propertyValue</code> is <code>address.zip</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, <code>value</code> is just the bad value that violated the validation constraint in the first place.</p>

<p>While we can use <code>InvalidValue</code> itself as a source of semi-user-friendly messages, it&rsquo;s clear that the defaults leave something to be desired. After all, <code>zip must match &ldquo;[0-9]+&rdquo;</code> wouldn&rsquo;t be what most users would consider user-friendly. We can however provide a resource bundle to improve the error messages and that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll look at now.</p>

<h3>Improving validation error messages using ValidatorMessages.properties</h3>


<p>With Hibernate Validator we can override the default messages associated with the various validation annotations. We can also provide highly specific error messages associated with property/constraint pairs. We do this using resource bundles. Though it&rsquo;s possible to provide Hibernate Validator with arbitrary resource bundles, the easiest approach is to create a <code>ValidatorMessages.properties</code> resource bundle on the classpath and use that. Hibernate Validator knows to look for that particular bundle (including any associated localizations) and use it as a message source. The next listing presents a simple example.</p>

<pre>validator.notEmpty=may not be null or empty!
validator.length=must be {max} or fewer characters.
zip.length=Please enter a {max}-character ZIP code.</pre>


<p>The first two lines of listing 3 provide alternatives for the <code>validator.notEmpty</code> and <code>validator.length</code> message keys. The key names are defined by the validation annotations themselves, so consult the Javadocs for the annotations if you need the key names (though you should be able to figure them out using the examples above).</p>

<p>Notice the <code>{max}</code> that appears in the message for the <code>validator.length</code> key. You can reference annotation elements from messages using the brace syntax. Consult the Javadocs for the various annotations&mdash;or else the Hibernate Validator reference manual&mdash;for a complete list of annotations and annotation elements.</p>

<p>The third line also specifies a message, but this time we&rsquo;re associating a message with the <code>zip.length</code> custom key we defined in listing 2. Note that here we don&rsquo;t use the braces for the key name. And also note that we can still reference annotation elements using the brace syntax. The custom message key approach is useful when you want to be very specific about the error message you provide to the end user.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what it looks like when you run it:</p>

<h3>Discussion</h3>


<p>That wraps it up for this tutorial. It&rsquo;s a good idea to get familiar with Hibernate Validator for a number of reasons:</p>

<ul class="square">
<li>Annotation-based declarative annotations are an intuitive and convenient way to specify validation constraints.</li>
<li>Hibernate Validator isn&#8217;t tied to any particular application tier.</li>
<li>It will support the JSR 303 standard once that finalizes.</li>
</ul>


<p>We haven&rsquo;t explored everything that Hibernate Validator has to offer. For instance, it&rsquo;s possible to configure it such that Hibernate ORM automatically runs Hibernate Validator when performing persistence operations.</p>

<p>One slight annoyance that I&rsquo;ve found is that there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be built-in way to substitute the bad value into the message itself. Sometimes I like to have messages like</p>

<p><code>willie2gmail.com is not a valid e-mail address</code></p>

<p>I suppose that I could create messages like</p>

<p><code>{1} is not a valid e-mail address</code></p>

<p>and then perform the substitution when processing the <code>InvalidValue</code> array, but it would be nice to be able to do this out of the box. Maybe there&rsquo;s a way to do it after all, but if so, I haven&rsquo;t found it.</p>

<p>Also, the documentation for Hibernate Validator is a little thin, both with respect to the reference manual and the Javadocs. Hopefully as JSR 303 matures we&rsquo;ll see improvements in this area. In the meantime, this tutorial will be my contribution to helping people understand Hibernate Validator.</p>

<p>Before I continue describing Juergen&rsquo;s first talk, I did attend another of his talks just a while ago and it seems like Spring 3/JEE 6 integration is going to be &ldquo;interesting,&rdquo; especially as concerns Spring integration with the forthcoming Java Web Beans effort (and to a lesser extent, EJB 3.1).  He didn&rsquo;t work too hard to hide his displeasure at the unattributed fashion in which many of the core ideas from Spring are making their way into the JEE specs. He described Web Beans as being a standardized DI framework with a focus on supporting scoped beans (request, conversation, session, application, etc.), and noted that many of the annotations from Web Beans and EJB 3.1 have direct counterparts in Spring. Taken together it sounds like Web Beans + EJB 3.1 will compete with Spring, with Web Beans handling the user component model and EJB 3.1 providing platform services (transaction management, container-managed security and so forth).</p>

<p>Anyway regarding Spring 3 and JEE 6, it will be fun to watch as it unfolds.  :&ndash;)</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s some more information related to how Spring 3 will support JEE 6:</p>

<ul>
<li>JSF 2.0: full compatibility as managed bean facility</li>
<li>JPA 2.0: support for lock modes and query timeouts (Hibernate supports these, but this is new for JPA)</li>
<li>JAX-RS and Jersey reference implementation (part of Glassfish): Spring will support these though they see JAX-RS as an alternative to Spring Web MVC&#8217;s REST support. Juergen said that he sees JAX-RS for more &#8220;hardcore&#8221; RESTful web service applications, and it&#8217;s a completely separate component model for building programmatic resource endpoints.</li>
<li>JSR 236 WorkManager and TimerManager: Rich, standardized access to thread pools. This spec is behind schedule so it won&#8217;t be in Spring 3. Maybe Spring 3.1. Juergen is excited about this though it sounded like it&#8217;s more from the framework perspective than from the app developer perspective.</li>
<li>Servlet 3.0: This won&#8217;t be supported til Spring 3.1 or Spring 3.2, but two major items here are (1) auto-deployment of framework integration classes (I didn&#8217;t fully catch what this meant&#8211;I couldn&#8217;t tell if it&#8217;s about hot-deploying JARs or what), and (2) support for Comet requests. The Comet support would include new HTTP request and response types.
<li>EJB 3.1 and Web Beans as described above. Just depends where the specs go.</li>
</ul>


<p>The Spring team is tracking GlassFish 3 and Tomcat 7 as well.</p>

<h3>JSR 303: Bean Validation</h3>


<p>This one looks like it will be for Spring 3.1 rather than Spring 3.0 since the Bean Validation spec isn&rsquo;t done yet. The idea though is that JSR 303 provides a declarative, annotation-based model for defining validation constraints, and so instead of forcing developers to invoke validation manually, the framework would automatically invoke it at appropriate places.  I haven&rsquo;t played much with Hibernate Validator yet but I think you can make Hibernate automatically validate persistent objects before saving them.  So the same sort of thing would occur elsewhere.  For example Spring Web MVC will I believe automatically invoke validation after doing form binding.</p>

<p>I did ask about the Bean Validation Framework (from the Spring Modules project), and whether that was dead. I think for a brief moment he didn&rsquo;t know what I was talking about when I said &ldquo;Bean Validation Framework&rdquo; (not a good sign for the BVF), and when I mentioned Spring Modules he said [paraphrasing here]: yeah, BVF is pretty much dead, use Hibernate Validator instead. My brother asked Uri Boness (BVF lead) about it several months back and he said roughly the same thing, that the best bet is for people to use Hibernate Validator and plan on JSR 303 being the future of validation.</p>

<p>Spring 3.0 will support Hibernate Validator annotations but the real goal is to support JSR 303 annotations.</p>

<h3>Portlet 2.0 support</h3>


<p>Some major Portlet 2.0 capabilities include:</p>

<ul>
<li>An explicit action name concept for dispatching</li>
<li>Two new request types: resource requests for servlet-style serving, and events for inter-portlet communication</li>
<li>Portlet filters, which are analogous to servlet filters</li>
</ul>


<p>Spring 3 will have Portlet 2.0 support. In particular, Portlet MVC 3.0 will support the following mapping annotations: <code>@ActionMapping</code>, <code>@RenderMapping</code>, <code>@ResourceMapping</code>, and <code>@EventMapping</code>. Conceptually these are specializations of Spring Web MVC&rsquo;s <code>@RequestMapping</code> annotation even though there&rsquo;s no explicit subtype relationship here.</p>

<p>Some other odds and ends:</p>

<ul>
<li>In the Spring EL there will be some scope-sensitive Portlet-related implicit objects such as the current <code>PortletRequest</code> and <code>PortletSession</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>@RequestHeader</code> and <code>@CookieValue</code> annotations I mentioned yesterday will work for both Servlet MVC and Portlet MVC.</li>
</ul>


<p>Juergen also described some areas of research. These aren&rsquo;t necessarily going into Spring 3 anytime soon but they&rsquo;re just taking a look right now.</p>

<h3>Research area #1: Conversation management</h3>


<p>A key problem in conversation management is isolating concurrent windows in the same browser. Historically this has been the domain of Spring Web Flow, but there&rsquo;s some thought of moving some level of conversation management to Spring Core. The idea is to introduce a new scope that&rsquo;s larger than a single request but smaller than an entire session&mdash;a conversation&mdash;and be able to handle that, along the lines of the MyFaces Orchestra project.</p>

<p>This is just me editorializing now, but I&rsquo;m myself a little dubious of the usefulness of a conversation scope if the goal is really just managing different browser windows. To me it seems like running a single app in multiple browser windows is a corner case. I suspect that what&rsquo;s going on is that Spring is responding to the fact that JEE 6 Web Beans will have a conversation scope.</p>

<p>If the goal is to handle Spring Web Flow-type scenarios (single window) then yeah, that I can see. Anyway.</p>

<h3>Research area #2: Scoped bean serializability</h3>


<p>Sometimes you want to be able to serialize beans, but you can&rsquo;t, because they contain references (either directly or indirectly) to unserializable objects, like e.g. DataSources. They&rsquo;re looking at ways to address this.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what sorts of serialization scenarios they have in mind. Originally I was thinking Juergen was talking about saving out sessions during server shutdowns (like Tomcat does) and stuff like that, but as I write this, that doesn&rsquo;t seem right, because your domain objects wouldn&rsquo;t have DataSource references. So apparently some people want to save managed objects, which seems odd since those managed objects (controllers, service beans, DAOs, etc.) are usually stateless. Oh well. I don&rsquo;t doubt that somebody has some reasonable use case here; I just don&rsquo;t myself know exactly what people have in mind on this one.</p>

<p>Hm&hellip; but scoped beans would typically be domain objects&hellip; heh, I&rsquo;m totally confused on this one.  :&ndash;)</p>

<p>Anyway, the Spring team is thinking about how best to handle this. Juergen offered that one &ldquo;solution&rdquo; is just to design your apps so that they don&rsquo;t involve serializing scoped beans. Another idea might be to have serializable proxies that are able to reconstitute the scoped bean when the proxy is initialized.</p>

<p>Spring 3 will also address a handful of housekeeping items.</p>

<h3>Housekeeping and portfolio rearrangements</h3>


<p>Some portfolio rearrangements include:</p>

<ul>
<li>There will be a revised OXM modules as part of the core, rather than just being part of Spring Web Services, as there are broader areas of applicability, including XML payloads in REST and XML datatypes in the database.</li>
<li>The binding and type conversion infrastructure will be revised. It will include capabilities from Spring Web Flow&#8217;s binding, and there will be EL integration here.</li>
<li>Spring 3.0 will include the core functionality of Spring JavaConfig, which basically allows you to configure application contexts from Java instead of using XML.</li>
</ul>




<h3>Deprecation and pruning</h3>


<p>The following will be deprecated:</p>

<ul>
<li>The traditional MVC controller class hierarchy (deprecated in Spring 3.0, removed entirely in Spring 3.1).</li>
<li>Traditional JUnit 3.8 test class hierarchy (this will be replaced with the test context framework)</li>
<li>Various outdated helper classes</li>
</ul>


<p>The following will be removed in Spring 3.0:</p>

<ul>
<li>Commons Attributes support</li>
<li>TopLink API support (replace with JPA/EclipseLink)</li>
<li>Support for Struts 1.x subclass-style actions</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This morning I attended a talk by Juergen Hoeller on what&rsquo;s coming in Spring 3.0. First, he said that we can expect the first milestone release sometime this week, and said that he expected there to be about three milestone releases I think. RC1 is supposed to be out around March 2009 and final around April 2009.</p>

<p>Echoing something I&rsquo;ve heard Keith Donald say, Juergen said that Spring 3.0 is intended to complete the work that was started in Spring 2.5. Keith described the release as being &ldquo;evolutionary, not revolutionary.&rdquo; That may be, but there&rsquo;s still quite a bit to be excited about.  Here&rsquo;s what I got from the talk today. (Hold onto your hats because I took good notes.)</p>

<h3>Java and JEE compatibility</h3>


<p>Spring 3.0 will be the first release that requires Java 5+. From SpringSource&rsquo;s perspective this is nice because they can avail themselves to generics, varargs, etc. But from the app developer&rsquo;s perspective, the idea is that the platform is really pushing use of annotations as the preferred way of doing configuration. So that means Java 5+.</p>

<p>Spring 3.0 will continue to be compatible with J2EE 1.4 and JEE 5. Also, as JEE 6 matures, Spring 3.0 will try to provide early support, but progress on JEE 6 has been somewhat slow and Spring 3.0 should be out before JEE 6. So Spring 3.1 and 3.2 will probably continue work in this direction. Anyway, SpringSource plans to support JSF 2.0, JPA 2.0, Servlet 3.0 when it&rsquo;s ready, etc.)</p>

<h3>Spring EL (Unified EL++)</h3>


<p>Juergen described support for expression languages as probably the most important and powerful feature in Spring 3.0. It will be a proprietary EL parser implementation&mdash;one of the few new modules that Spring 3.0 will introduce&mdash;and it sounded like it would like Unified EL but on steroids. They&rsquo;re trying to keep the EL pretty similar to how it works in JSF, and Spring&rsquo;s EL is designed to be stylistically and syntactically compatible with Unified EL. Also, even though right now Spring Web Flow 2 uses external EL implementations (JBoss EL implementation of Unified EL, I think, or else OGNL), SWF 3 will use Spring EL instead of an external implementation.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a code example he gave. This one is for EL in bean definitions:</p>

<pre>&lt;bean class="mycompany.RewardsTestDatabase"&gt;
    &lt;property name="databaseName" value="#{systemProperties.databaseName}"/&gt;
    &lt;property name="keyGenerator" value="#{strategyBean.databaseKeyGenerator}"/&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;</pre>


<p>The idea is this. Just like in other ELs, you will have some implicit objects&mdash;objects that you can reference in your EL either because the objects are global in scope or else because the object lives in your current scope (e.g., request scope, session scope, etc.). So in the example above, <code>systemProperties</code> is a global implicit object, and <code>strategyBean</code> is a bean name. Bean names will be available as EL objects then.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m assuming that the <code>databaseName</code> and <code>keyGenerator</code> properties will be evaluated each time they are accessed. Otherwise it wouldn&rsquo;t be much of an expression language. I&rsquo;m kind of curious to see how they do this. My guess is that the approach will be to proxy beans with EL-based properties, with the proxies evaluating the reference upon demand.</p>

<p>Juergen gave another example, this time of EL in component annotations. Here it is:</p>

<pre>
@Repository
public class RewardsTestDatabase {

    @Value("#{systemProperties.databaseName}")
    public void setDatabaseName(String dbName) { ... }

    @Value("#{strategyBean.databaseKeyGenerator}")
    public void setKeyGenerator(KeyGenerator kg) { ... }
}
</pre>


<p>I <i>believe</i> these two configuration examples are different in a subtle way. The value of the <code>@Value</code> attribute is a default value for the property if a value isn&rsquo;t explicitly defined in the app context. One practical benefit we get has to do with how component scanning currently works. When we component scan, we depend on autowiring to establish injected references. The problem is that if our dependencies are primitive types, autowiring is no longer an option and so we have to go explicit with our bean definitions. With EL-based defaults, we can keep the component scanning, and just set the primitive types using a bean, or maybe using system properties, etc.</p>

<h3>REST support</h3>


<p>Another big topic in Spring 3.0 is REST support. Spring Web MVC will provide first-class support for RESTful web services, and not necessarily just XML-based. Keith was saying that there will be a JSON view as well. So the web services would be useful not only in integration efforts but also for example when you have JavaScript widgets that want to make AJAX calls back to the server and get JSON. Anyway, Spring Web MVC&rsquo;s current design is such that it&rsquo;s really easy to tweak it a bit to support REST, and that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re doing. So one aspect of this would be to continue to use <code>@RequestMapping</code> to specify an HTTP method, such as <code>RequestMethod.PUT</code>.  Another piece would be to introduce a new <code>@PathVariable</code> annotation that works pretty much like <code>@RequestParam</code> currently works, but handles URL path segments instead of HTTP parameters. Here&rsquo;s a code example that shows how it will work:</p>

<pre>
@RequestMapping(value = "/show/{id}", method = GET)
public Reward show(@PathVariable("id") long id) {
    return this.rewardsAdminService.findReward(id);
}
</pre>


<p>I like it!</p>

<p>Another feature of the REST support is support for different representations, i.e. content negotiation. They want to use the HTTP <code>Accept</code> header as a new way to do view resolution. So presumably there will be a new <code>ViewResolver</code> implementation that looks at the <code>Accept</code> header and returns, say, an XML view (accepts <code>application/xml</code>), a JSON view (accepts <code>application/json</code>) or an ATOM view (accepts <code>application/atom+xml</code>) according to that header. This would be the preferred way of doing view resolution for the hardcore REST purists. But Spring Web MVC would also support extension-based resolution; e.g. <code>.json</code> maps to a <code>JsonView</code>, etc.</p>

<h3>Some @MVC refinements</h3>


<p>They&rsquo;re planning to add a couple of new @MVC annotations besides <code>@RequestParam</code> (which already exists) and the new <code>@PathVariable</code> annotation. These are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>@RequestHeader</code>: Grab HTTP request header data.</li>
<li><code>@CookieValue</code>: Grab cookie value. (Surprise!)</li>
</ul>


<p>These will allow us to get at the data without having to declare the raw <code>HttpServletRequest</code> as we currently have to do.  Here&rsquo;s a code sample:</p>

<pre>
@RequestMapping("/show")
public Reward show(@RequestHeader("region") long regionId,
    @CookieValue("language") String langId) {

    ...
}
</pre>


<p>There&rsquo;s quite a bit more, but this post is pretty long as it is and I need to hit the sack. I&rsquo;ll try to post a little more tomorrow.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m at SpringOne right now, and very much enjoying the <a href="http://www.diplomatresort.com/">Westin Diplomat</a>. My room is on the 21st floor and it overlooks the Atlantic. My balcony door is open and I can hear the waves crashing on the shore as I write. This is how life should always be. :&ndash;)</p>

<p>I attended Rod Johnson&rsquo;s keynote a couple of hours back. The keynote itself was informative, offering a pretty good glimpse into where SpringSource sees itself going over the coming year, and I had a chance to chat it up with Thomas Risberg and Colin Sampaleanu just a little bit since we were all sitting at the same table. Recognizing an opportunity when I see one, I asked them when they thought Spring 3 would be coming out and they laughed in a way that suggested that this wasn&rsquo;t the first time somebody had asked. Right now they&rsquo;re shooting for late March or thereabouts, though that was just their impression as opposed to a definite statement.</p>

<p>Anyway, here are some highlights from the keynote.</p>

<h3>SpringSource in 2008</h3>


<p>Rod started the keynote with some SpringSource efforts and accomplishments over 2008. I won&rsquo;t go into those in detail, but he mentioned several items, including</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.springsource.org/webflow">Spring Web Flow 2.0</a> GA: I remember it well as I wrote <a href="http://wheelersoftware.com/articles/spring-web-flow-2.0.html">an article</a> about it just before the GA and I wanted to make sure that nothing important had changed.</li>
    <li><a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring-batch/">Spring Batch</a> GA</li>
    <li>Launched new <a href="http://www.springsource.org/spring-integration">Spring Integration</a> project</li>
    <li>Preparing for Spring 3.0 GA</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.springsource.com/products/suite/dmserver">SpringSource dm Server</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.regdeveloper.co.uk/2008/01/29/springsource_buys_covalent/">Covalent Technologies acquisition</a>: ten years supporting Apache HTTP server and leading support provider for Tomcat (which is important to SpringSource&#8217;s strategy, as I&#8217;ll describe below)</li>
    <li><a href="http://broadcast.oreilly.com/2008/11/springsource-getting-into-the.html">G2One acquisition</a>: Bringing Groovy and Grails into SpringSource</li>
    <li>Several commercial software releases, including the <a href="http://www.springsource.com/products/suite/sts">SpringSource Tool Suite</a>, <a href="http://www.springsource.com/products/suite/ams">SpringSource Application Management Suite</a> and the <a href="http://www.springsource.com/products/suite/apfororacledb">SpringSource Advanced Pack for Oracle</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p>They&rsquo;ve clearly been a busy company over the past year, but it may not be entirely clear what they&rsquo;re up to. (Well, part of it is clear enough&mdash;they&rsquo;re moving into the app server space.) The next part of the keynote explained where SpringSource is going as a company.</p>

<h3>SpringSource in 2009</h3>


<p>Rod noted that 2008 has been a tough year for the world economy in general, and thus one reasonable prediction is that that&rsquo;s going to translate into pressure on IT budgets. One development he expects to see is license costs coming under increased scrutiny. Another is that he thinks IT will begin paying more attention to the costs associated with complexity, and will invest more in reducing that complexity.</p>

<p>I know from my own workplace that his ideas here are correct. Even before news broke that everything&rsquo;s melting down, we were reevaluating our license situation and indeed even in some cases making changes. And one of the themes that our CIO has sounded time and time again is that we need to work to reduce complexity when we can. I suspect that these are common themes anyway, but with the tough economic times it&rsquo;s pretty easy to believe that one can build a business strategy around this, and that&rsquo;s what SpringSource is doing.</p>

<h3>The SpringSource strategy: help customers control costs by managing and reducing complexity</h3>


<p>This was really the theme of the keynote and Rod noted that they&rsquo;d even changed their tagline to reflect it: &ldquo;Weapons for the War on Java Complexity.&rdquo; He explained how the various efforts over 2008 are generally aligned with managing complexity on different fronts. For example:</p>

<p><b>Continue targeting complexity in development by expanding the Spring Framework in a way that simplifies application development.</b> Rod showed how with each new release of Spring, the SLOC for the pet store application dropped. He highlighted Spring Web MVC, Spring Web Flow and the acquisition of G2One in particular as representing a continued commitment to simplifying application development. Another notable item here includes Spring 2.5-style configuration via annotations.</p>

<p>Spring 3.0 moves the platform further along in this simplifying direction. Some highlights:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Spring 3.0 will support EL in XML configuration and in annotations. He didn&#8217;t say exactly where this would appear.</li>
    <li>Spring Web MVC will provide first-class support for RESTful web services. The match is strong (Spring Web MVC already has a @RequestMapping attribute that serves well here), and RESTful remoting is simpler than say SOAP-based web services.</li>
    <li>With Spring Web MVC, developers should adopt the annotated POJO model as Spring 3.0 will deprecate the Controller hierarchy and 3.1 will probably eliminate it altogether. Again the argument is that this is simpler than XML configuration.</li>
    <li>Spring Web Flow should be seen not as a niche technology but as a core part of their web framework that potentially applies any time there&#8217;s a directed navigation requirement. Examples include wizards, back button, refresh, multiple UIs, and UI reuse.</li>
    <li>Speaking of their web framework, they&#8217;re treating the following four projects as constituting a coherent, layered set: Spring Web MVC (the core), Spring JavaScript and Spring Web Flow (sitting on top of Spring Web MVC), and Spring Faces (sitting on top of the other three). He said that historically Spring hadn&#8217;t simplified web development as much as it could have, and their converging the four aforementioned web technologies into a single group is an effort to address this.</li>
</ul>


<p>Finally (we&rsquo;re still on the topic of managing complexity in development), Rod suggested that we take a look at <a href="http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/api/org/springframework/beans/factory/annotation/Configurable.html">@Configurable</a> (which was available in Spring 2.0) and consider it a &ldquo;secret weapon&rdquo; against complexity.</p>

<p>The other major way in which SpringSource aims to manage/reduce complexity:</p>

<p><b>Target complexity not only in development but also in operations:</b> Though it&rsquo;s by no means unanimous, lots of people feel that Spring has done a pretty nice job of simplifying JEE development. Their idea is now to take that to the data center. Their commercial offerings align with this; for example, the Application Management Suite provides deep diagnostics for Spring-based applications, and the dm Server aims to make release management simpler and more flexible. Besides their commercial offerings, their investment in Covalent Technologies (better access to Apache and Tomcat expertise) represents a desire to strengthen their offering in hosting and operations.</p>

<p>They see Tomcat as being the platform of choice where WAR-based deployments are concerned, but they see server-side OSGi as the wave of the future. Because Tomcat is currently widely deployed (I think Rod said something like 70% of enterprises have deployed Tomcat?), SpringSource wants to be involved there, and that&rsquo;s why they bought Covalent. But at the same time they are trying to encourage their customers and indeed the industry at large to make the transition to OSGi-based deployment.</p>

<p>And this leads to a couple of announcements he made.</p>

<h3>A couple of product announcements</h3>


<p><b>tc Server:</b> The first announcement was that SpringSource will be releasing another server product to complement their current dm Server offering. This one is called tc Server for (you guessed it) Tomcat Server, and the idea is that it&rsquo;s an enhanced version of Tomcat, one that includes management functionality to make it &ldquo;ready for the data center.&rdquo; The AMS product comes with it, and it will provide features such as visibility into Tomcat and app performance stats, deadlock detection, heap and thread dumps, and stuff like that. It will also be possible to manage tc Server WAR deployments through AMS. They&rsquo;re expecting (if I understood correctly) a GA release in January 2009.</p>

<p>Rod emphasized that the Spring Framework itself would remain server-agnostic, despite the fact that SpringSource is a server vendor.</p>

<p><b>SpringSource Application Platform Configurator:</b> The second announcement is that SpringSource will be making available a web application called the SpringSource Application Platform Configurator. Again, managing complexity is the driver here. This time they are addressing the complexity associated with managing dependencies between JAR files, eliminating version conflicts, and that sort of thing. The idea is that you go to this app (which they host), and you specify a bunch of parameters such as the app type (web app, Grails, batch, etc.), whether you&rsquo;re OK with including pre-release software (such as milestone releases) or whether you allow only GAs, what sorts of capabilities you want and where your religious allegiances lie (is it OK to include JSF? is it OK to include Flex?), what hosting provider you&rsquo;re using (WebSphere, WebLogic, dm Server, etc.), what OS, etc. (By the way, they don&rsquo;t explicitly ask &ldquo;where are your religious allegiances,&rdquo; but Rod noted that they recognize this reality of how software is sometimes chosen and the configurator is designed accordingly.) Then at the end you register (free), get a text dump of the JARs you just chose, and get a dynamically-generated ZIP containing those JARs (and they&rsquo;re of course mutually consistent so as to avoid versioning conflicts). That&rsquo;s a cool idea. They don&rsquo;t know though when this will be available for use; it&rsquo;s not even in beta yet.</p>

<p>Well, there you have it. If you weren&rsquo;t at the keynote, now it&rsquo;s as if you were.  :&ndash;)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll post more as the conference progresses. Here&rsquo;s <a href="http://greybeardedgeek.net/?p=66">another post</a> on the same keynote.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At the time of this writing, Spring 3.0 isn&rsquo;t out yet, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t start goofing around with the <a href="http://static.springframework.org/downloads/nightly/snapshot-download.php?project=SPR">nightly snapshots</a>. I&rsquo;ve been doing just that, and in this article I&rsquo;ll show you how to publish an RSS feed using the new <code>AbstractRssFeedView</code> class from Spring 3.0.</p>

<p>Those familiar with <a href="https://springmodules.dev.java.net/">Spring Modules</a> might recognize our view class. It began life as <code>AbstractRssView</code> in the Spring Modules project. But as of Spring 3.0, it&rsquo;s now a first-class member of the framework (though it&rsquo;s been renamed to <code>AbstractRssFeedView</code>), along with the <code>AbstractAtomFeedView</code> class for Atom feeds, and the <code>AbstractFeedView</code>, which serves as a base class for both. The new classes, like the old one, are based on Sun&rsquo;s <a href="https://rome.dev.java.net/">ROME API</a>.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll need to know Spring Web MVC to get the most out of this article. In particular, you&rsquo;ll need to understand the relationship between controllers and views, which in a nutshell is this: when a controller is done processing a request, it returns a logical view name that a view resolver subsequently maps to a view.</p>

<p>Without further ado, let&rsquo;s look at some code.</p>

<h3>The controller</h3>


<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the controller, since processing starts there, and since that&rsquo;s probably more familiar to more readers than implementing views. Here&rsquo;s a pretty basic controller for a news feed.</p>

<pre>package rssdemo.web;

import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Required;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import org.springframework.ui.Model;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
import rssdemo.model.NewsItem;
import rssdemo.service.NewsService;

@Controller
public final class NewsController {
    private NewsService newsService;
    private String rssNewsFeedView;
    
    @Required
    public void setNewsService(NewsService newsService) {
        this.newsService = newsService;
    }
    
    @Required
    public void setRssNewsFeedView(String rssNewsFeedView) {
        this.rssNewsFeedView = rssNewsFeedView;
    }
    
    @RequestMapping("/news.rss")
    public String rss(HttpServletResponse res, Model model) {
        List&lt;NewsItem&gt; newsItems = newsService.getAllNewsItems();
        model.addAttribute(newsItems);                                     // 1
        return rssNewsFeedView;                                            // 2
    }
}
</pre>


<p>As you can see, this controller really is as simple as I said it would be. Our <code>rss()</code> method grabs a list of <code>NewsItem</code>s from the <code>NewsService</code> <span class="cueball">1</span> and places it on the <code>Model</code> under a conventionally-generated key, which in this case would be <code>newsItemList</code>. Then we simply return an injected logical view name <span class="cueball">2</span>, which we&rsquo;re going to map to an actual view shortly. (We inject the view name to maintain the separation between the controller and the view.)</p>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s check out the star of the show, which would be our view.</p>

<h3>The view, via Spring 3.0&#8217;s new AbstractRssFeedView</h3>


<p>Now we come to the meat of the subject. Here we&rsquo;re going to implement a Spring Web MVC view by extending Spring 3.0&rsquo;s new <code>AbstractRssFeedView</code> class and by using ROME to model our news feed. Once we have the view in place, we&rsquo;ll be ready to configure the mapping from the logical view name we set in the controller to the view.</p>

<p>The next listing what&rsquo;s involved in implementing a view for an RSS feed. If you&rsquo;re doing an Atom feed, the approach is entirely analogous, but you would just need to extend <code>AbstractAtomFeedView</code> instead of <code>AbstractRssFeedView</code>.</p>

<pre>package rssdemo.web;

import java.util.*;
import javax.servlet.http.*;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Required;
import org.springframework.web.servlet.view.feed.AbstractRssFeedView;
import com.sun.syndication.feed.rss.Channel;
import com.sun.syndication.feed.rss.Description;
import com.sun.syndication.feed.rss.Item;
import rssdemo.model.NewsItem;

public final class RssNewsFeedView extends AbstractRssFeedView {           // 1
    private String feedTitle;                                              // 2
    private String feedDesc;
    private String feedLink;
    
    @Required
    public void setFeedTitle(String feedTitle) {
        this.feedTitle = feedTitle;
    }
    
    @Required
    public void setFeedDescription(String feedDesc) {
        this.feedDesc = feedDesc;
    }
    
    @Required
    public void setFeedLink(String feedLink) {
        this.feedLink = feedLink;
    }

    @Override
    protected void buildFeedMetadata(
            Map model, Channel feed, HttpServletRequest request) {         // 3
        
        feed.setTitle(feedTitle);
        feed.setDescription(feedDesc);
        feed.setLink(feedLink);
    }
    
    @Override
    protected List&lt;Item&gt; buildFeedItems(
            Map model,
            HttpServletRequest request,
            HttpServletResponse response)
        throws Exception {                                                 // 4
        
        @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
        List&lt;NewsItem&gt; newsItems =
            (List&lt;NewsItem&gt;) model.get("newsItemList");                    // 5
        
        List&lt;Item&gt; feedItems = new ArrayList&lt;Item&gt;();
        for (NewsItem newsItem : newsItems) {                              // 6
            Item feedItem = new Item();
            feedItem.setTitle(newsItem.getTitle());
            feedItem.setAuthor(newsItem.getAuthor());
            feedItem.setPubDate(newsItem.getDatePublished());
            
            Description desc = new Description();
            desc.setType("text/html");
            desc.setValue(newsItem.getDescription());
            feedItem.setDescription(desc);
            
            feedItem.setLink(newsItem.getLink());
            feedItems.add(feedItem);
        }
        
        return feedItems;
    }
}</pre>


<p>So what&rsquo;s going on here? Well, we begin by extending the <code>AbstractRssFeedView</code> class <span class="cueball">1</span>. Then we include some injected fields for feed metadata <span class="cueball">2</span>. We use these in the optional <code>buildFeedMetadata()</code> method <span class="cueball">3</span>. I say &ldquo;optional&rdquo; because the <code>AbstractRssFeedView</code> provides a dummy implementation (actually, its superclass <code>AbstractFeedView</code> provides it).</p>

<p>The method we&rsquo;re required to implement is <code>buildFeedItems()</code> <span class="cueball">4</span>. Here&rsquo;s where we map our list of domain objects (here, a list of <code>NewsItem</code> objects that are just something we cooked up ourselves) to the ROME API, which provides a structure for modeling feeds. We begin by grabbing the <code>NewsItem</code> list off the model (recall from listing 1 that we placed the list on the model in the controller) <span class="cueball">5</span>. Then we iterate over the <code>NewsItem</code> list, mapping each one to a ROME <code>Item</code> <span class="cueball">6</span>.</p>

<p>That should be pretty straightforward-looking. And we&rsquo;re almost done. There&rsquo;s just one part that remains, and that&rsquo;s establishing the mapping between the logical view name we return from the controller and the <code>RssNewsFeedView</code> that we just created. We do that in the application context.</p>

<h3>Configure the view resolver for your RSS feed</h3>


<p>The last thing we need to take care of is configuring up the right view resolver in our application context. We can&rsquo;t use the standard <code>InternalResourceViewResolver</code> here because we&rsquo;re not mapping to a URL; instead we want to map to a view (namely, the <code>RssNewsFeedView</code> that we just created) and we want that view to handle generating the output directly.</p>

<p>The simplest approach here is to use something called the <code>BeanNameViewResolver</code>. The idea with this type of resolver is quite simple. Whenever a controller returns a logical view name, the <code>BeanNameViewResolver</code> will attempt to find a bean on the application context with the same name (or ID). If there&rsquo;s a match, then it interprets that bean as the mapped view. Otherwise, the other resolvers are given their shot at matching the view name.</p>

<p>To add a <code>BeanNameViewResolver</code>, all we need to add is this:</p>

<pre>&lt;bean class="org.springframework.web.servlet.view.BeanNameViewResolver"/&gt;</pre>


<p>We also need to inject the view name into our controller, as we saw in listing 1. Here&rsquo;s how we can do that:</p>

<pre>&lt;bean class="rssdemo.web.NewsController"
    p:newsService-ref="newsService"
    p:rssNewsFeedView="rssNewsFeedView"/&gt;</pre>


<p>We just chose the name <code>rssNewsFeedView</code> more or less arbitrarily; we could have chosen anything. It&rsquo;s good to choose something accurate and descriptive just to keep things clear and the minimize the chance of a mapping conflict, since the name you choose is going to be a bean name. Speaking of which, we&rsquo;ll need to put our view on the app context too:</p>

<pre>&lt;bean id="rssNewsFeedView"
    class="rssdemo.web.RssNewsFeedView"
    p:feedTitle="Ye Olde Cigar Shoppe"
    p:feedDescription="Latest and greatest news about cigars"
    p:feedLink="http://yeoldecigarshoppe.com/"/&gt;</pre>


<p>And there you have it! When the <code>DispatcherServlet</code> gets a request for the RSS feed, it will run the controller method and then grab the resulting view name, which we&rsquo;ve configured to be <code>rssNewsFeedView</code>. Then the <code>BeanNameViewResolver</code> will find the corresponding view bean on the app context&mdash;in this case our <code>RssNewsFeedView</code>&mdash;and the view bean will finish up the request as required. All in all a nice, clean way of handling feed publication.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class="alert info">This material is based on an earlier version of <a href="http://www.manning.com/wheeler/">Spring in Practice, chapter 8</a>&mdash;one that predates the <code>@Async</code> annotation. Nowadays I would recommend using <code>@Async</code> and the Spring Task Execution API for making JavaMail calls asynchonous. The book covers the newer approach. The material in this post is still useful for understanding what you can do with AOP though.</div>


<p>In this article we&rsquo;ll learn how we can speed up Spring&rsquo;s <code>JavaMailSenderImpl</code> with some thread-forking AOP. Though we&rsquo;re using JavaMail as an example, this tutorial should be useful to people looking for a code-based introduction to Spring&rsquo;s support for AOP. Note at the outset that I don&rsquo;t really go into AOP concepts and terminology, but I do show some simple code that you should be able to follow if you already know the basic concepts and just want to see what the code looks like.</p>

<p>There are lots of situations in which we want our application to send out an automated e-mail. You might for instance want to send a confirmation e-mail in response to new user registrations or mailing list subscriptions and unsubscriptions. In Spring this probably means that you would use one of the various <code>JavaMailSenderImpl.send()</code> methods. Here&rsquo;s a sample <code>applicationContext.xml</code> file.</p>

<pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
    xmlns:jee="http://www.springframework.org/schema/jee"
    xmlns:p="http://www.springframework.org/schema/p"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-2.5.xsd
        http://www.springframework.org/schema/jee http://www.springframework.org/schema/jee/spring-jee-2.5.xsd&gt;
    
    &lt;jee:jndi-lookup id="mailSession" jndi-name="mail/Session" resource-ref="true"/&gt;
    
    &lt;bean id="mailSender"
        class="org.springframework.mail.javamail.JavaMailSenderImpl"
        p:session-ref="mailSession"/&gt;
    
    &lt;bean id="mailingListService"
        class="app.service.MailingListServiceImpl"
        p:mailSender-ref="mailSender"/&gt;
        
    ...
    
&lt;/beans&gt;</pre>


<p>Here&rsquo;s how it looks from the Java side:</p>

<pre>package app.service;

... imports ...

public class MailingListServiceImpl implements MailingListService {
    private JavaMailSender mailSender;
    
    public void setMailSender(JavaMailSender mailSender) {
        this.mailSender = mailSender;
    }
    
    private void sendConfirmSubscriptionEmail(Subscriber subscriber) {
        MimeMessage message = mailSender.createMimeMessage();
        MimeMessageHelper helper = new MimeMessageHelper(message);
        
        String text = ...
        
        try {
            helper.setSubject("Please confirm your subscription");
            helper.setTo(subscriber.getEmail());
            helper.setFrom(noReplyEmailAddress);
            helper.setSentDate(subscriber.getDateCreated());
            helper.setText(text, true);
        } catch (MessagingException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
        
        mailSender.send(message);
    }
    
    ...
}</pre>


<p>(For more information on Spring/JavaMail integration, please see my article <a href="#">Send E-mail Using Spring and JavaMail</a>.)</p>

<p>This works fine, but one thing your end users might notice is a fairly significant delay while <code>JavaMailSenderImpl.send()</code> does whatever it&rsquo;s doing to send your e-mail (presumably <a href="http://springinpractice.com/2008/05/05/smtp-and-smtp-auth/">negotiating with the SMTP server and sending the actual e-mail</a>). While the delay probably isn&rsquo;t large enough to provoke rioting in the streets, it&rsquo;s certainly noticeable, and in many use cases it&rsquo;s unnecessary. E-mail is itself an asynchronous communications medium, so unless there&rsquo;s an important reason to let the end user know about errors that may occur while trying to send the e-mail (and there may be), one option you might consider is making the <code>send()</code> call on a separate thread.</p>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s look at a few different ways to do that.</p>

<h3>Method 1: Spawn a new thread manually</h3>


<p>One possibility would be to spawn a new thread manually whenever you want to call <code>JavaMailSenderImpl.send()</code>. In other words, you implement the <code>Runnable</code> interface with a call to <code>send()</code>, you pass it into a <code>Thread</code>, and then you start the thread.</p>

<p>This technique has some advantages. It&rsquo;s conceptually straightforward. Also it&rsquo;s easy to be selective about the cases in which you do and don&rsquo;t want to fork. Again, there may well be times where you want the end user to know if the <code>send()</code> call generated an exception, and if that&rsquo;s true, then you simply refrain from forking the thread.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re not careful, the approach can lead to widespread violation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY principle</a>. You might end up rewriting the same thread-forking code every time you send an e-mail. You can of course control this by creating one or more utility methods to send an e-mail on a separate thread, and that is a good approach.</p>

<p>One drawback with this approach, though, is that it may be either inconvenient or else a non-option. If you have an existing app with lots of calls to create e-mail, then you&rsquo;d need to update all the instances of that code with the new code. In most cases that&rsquo;s probably doable though it may be inconvenient. But it may be that you&rsquo;re not in a position to change the client code. (Maybe it&rsquo;s a third-party library, for instance.) The client code calls an injected <code>JavaMailSender</code> instance, say, and that&rsquo;s the way it is. In that event you&rsquo;ll want to consider one of the two following alternative methods.</p>

<h3>Method 2: Create a JavaMailSender wrapper</h3>


<p>Another method would be to implement a <code>JavaMailSender</code> wrapper. (<code>JavaMailSender</code> is of course the interface to which <code>JavaMailSenderImpl</code> conforms.) The <code>JavaMailSender</code> interface has six different <code>send()</code> methods (<a href="http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.5.6/api/org/springframework/mail/javamail/JavaMailSender.html">here are the Javadocs</a>), and so you can just implement the thread-forking code for each of the six methods. (Probably each method would create a <code>Runnable</code> and then pass that to a thread-forking utility method.) Then you inject your wrapper into your service beans instead of injecting the <code>JavaMailSenderImpl</code> bean directly.</p>

<p>This approach is pretty good. It&rsquo;s still straightforward, and it allows you to avoid violating DRY. Also, because it&rsquo;s entirely transparent to client code, it can deal with cases in which you either can&rsquo;t or else don&rsquo;t want to modify said client code.</p>

<p>One possible challenge is that you may find it a little tough to exercise fine-grained control over the cases in which you use the wrapper and the cases in which you don&rsquo;t. If it&rsquo;s important for your code to exercise that kind of control, then arguably it would be reasonable to associate the forking/non-forking semantics injected <code>JavaMailSender</code> beans. You might for example inject two <code>JavaMailSender</code> instances into the service bean&mdash;one forking and one non-forking.</p>

<p>A minor grumble about the wrapper method is that it ties the thread-forking behavior to specific interfaces, such as <code>JavaMailSender</code>. That&rsquo;s not too big a deal in this particular case, since it&rsquo;s not such a problem to spawn a new thread. But if you have other cases where you decide you want to create a new thread, you might decide that you&rsquo;d like to factor thread-forking out as a separate behavior and be able to apply that in multiple contexts.</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s see how to do that using Spring&rsquo;s support for AspectJ-flavored AOP.</p>

<h3>Method 3: Use AOP to wrap JavaMailSenderImpl.send()</h3>


<p>This is a fun and elegant method. Even though this article is called &ldquo;AOP 101&rdquo;, I&rsquo;m not planning to explain the concepts or weird terminology; rather I just want to show you the code and assume that you&rsquo;ll be able to see what&rsquo;s happening.</p>

<p>First we need to create an &ldquo;advice&rdquo; class. This is the code that we&rsquo;re going to wrap around our <code>send()</code> invocations.</p>

<pre>package app.aop;

import org.apache.log4j.Logger;
import org.aspectj.lang.ProceedingJoinPoint;

public class ForkAdvice {
    private static final Logger log = Logger.getLogger(ForkAdvice.class);
    
    public void fork(final ProceedingJoinPoint pjp) {
        new Thread(new Runnable() {
            public void run() {
                log.info("Forking method execution: " + pjp);
                try {
                    pjp.proceed();
                } catch (Throwable t) {
                    // All we can do is log the error.
                    log.error(t);
                }
            }
        }).start();
    }
}</pre>


<p>The fork method is &ldquo;around&rdquo; advice that we&rsquo;re going to use to advise our calls to <code>JavaMailSenderImpl.send()</code>. As you can see, it creates a new thread and starts it. In the <code>run()</code> body, we simply execute the advised method by calling <code>pjp.proceed()</code>.</p>

<p>As an aside, the <code>ProceedingJoinPoint</code> class is provided by the AspectJ class library, but note that we&rsquo;re not using full-blown AspectJ here&mdash;we&rsquo;re in fact using Spring AOP. Full AspectJ involves a special aspect language and compiler to generate classes with the advice woven into the class bytecode itself. Spring AOP on the other hand uses dynamic proxies (either the interface variety that comes with Java, or else class proxies via CGLIB) to advise classes. While Spring AOP borrows classes and also the AspectJ pointcut language from AspectJ, its use of dynamic (runtime) proxies as opposed to bytecode-level advice integration distinguishes it from AspectJ.</p>

<p>Now it&rsquo;s time to update our application context with our AOP configuration.</p>

    ...
    
&lt;/beans&gt;</pre>


<p>This is similar to what we had before, but there are a couple of differences. First, note that we&rsquo;ve declared the <code>aop</code> namespace here. That of course allows us to use the namespace configuration feature that Spring 2.0 introduced. The other change is that we&rsquo;ve added a definition for our advice bean as well as some AOP configuration. In <code>aop:aspect</code> we point to our <code>forkAdvice</code> as the advising class to be applied, we indicate that it will be &ldquo;around&rdquo; advice, we specify the advising method, and finally we specify a pointcut that indicates which method calls will be advised/wrapped. We use the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/doc/released/progguide/semantics-pointcuts.html">AspectJ pointcut language</a> to specify a pointcut. Here we&rsquo;re indicating that we want all calls to any of the <code>JavaMailSenderImpl.send()</code> methods to be advised.</p>

<p>As mentioned previously, this technique is like the wrapper technique in that you can use it to add the forking behavior in a way that&rsquo;s transparent to client code. Moreover you can use it not just for JavaMail but really for any method where you want to create a new thread before executing the method. You just add the appropriate <code>aop:around</code> definitions to the <code>aop:aspect</code> definition and you&rsquo;re in business.</p>
