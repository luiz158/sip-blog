About this blog
===============
This is Willie Wheeler's blog for the Manning title, Spring in Practice, by Willie Wheeler and Joshua White. It provides supplemental materials for the book. In some cases it's material that's more conceptual or theoretical in nature (and thus didn't mesh well with the cookbook format). In other cases we just ran out of room in the book itself. But mostly it's extra content that I wrote after the chapters were already done. I'll post additional content and also errata here over time.

Most, but not all, of the posts here are about Spring. Every now and then there's the odd devops, user experience or other post, just because I've consolidated content from a couple of other blogs onto this one.


About me
========
I'm Willie Wheeler, living in beautiful Sammamish, WA. My family and I are recent transplants from Phoenix. We love it up here, rain and all.

I've been doing Java/Spring development for a long time (Java since 1997, Spring since about 2005), and as you might guess from all the blog posts, I enjoy it.

At my day job, I'm a Principal Applications Engineer at Expedia, working in devops. (Standard disclaimer&mdash;the statements and views on this site are my own, not necessarily my employer's.)

I'm always excited to hear from people who have similar interests, so feel free to drop me a note if you feel like chatting about Spring, devops, blogging or whatever. Just no Ugg boots or Cialis please.
