I'm in the process of migrating the blog from Wordpress to [Octopress](http://octopress.org/). Octopress is a lot easier to hack and in fact was designed for the hacker crowd. Plus I like being able to manage my posts in source control instead of in a database. Makes sense for all kinds of reasons.

It might take a bit for the dust to settle, but that's what's going on.

If you're interested in the XSLT script I wrote to migrate the posts, please see [wordpress2octopress](https://github.com/williewheeler/wordpress2octopress).
