We're very excited to announce that we've been MEAPed. :-)

MEAP is the Manning Early Access Program. MEAP allows you to buy the book before it's actually done so you can start getting at the content as it becomes available.

We just released the first pair of chapters: Chapter 4 (User registrations) and Chapter 5 (Authentication). Also the table of contents is online for those who are interested.
