My <a href="http://refcardz.dzone.com/refcardz/expression-based-authorization?oid=hom25493">Spring Security 3 Refcard</a> is out. It covers expression-based authorization in Spring Security 3.

There is also a supporting <a href="http://java.dzone.com/articles/willie-wheeler-spring-security3-interview">interview</a> about the Refcard. The interview goes into more depth about some security principles like whitelisting and data-driven security, and explains how to implement these ideas using Spring Security 3.
