One of the things we're working on is an open source configuration management system called <a title="Skybase" href="https://github.com/williewheeler/skybase">Skybase</a>. It's a new project, and we're still working out a lot of the high-level vision for this thing. I'll post more information about it later, but for now I just wanted to post some screenshots as a way for people to see how it looks. We're using <a title="Twitter Bootstrap" href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter Bootstrap</a> for the CSS (very nice toolkit--love it), and Spring/<a title="Neo4j" href="http://neo4j.org/">Neo4j</a> (along with <a title="Spring Data Neo4j" href="http://www.springsource.org/spring-data/neo4j">Spring Data Neo4j</a>) on the backend. So far the Neo4j graph data is working out great for configuration management data.

Anyway here are the screenshots. (Click on any of the screenshots for a larger view.)

First, the dashboard:

Here's the project details page:

And here's the page that allows you to create a new project:
