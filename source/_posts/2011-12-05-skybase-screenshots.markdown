One of the things we're working on is an open source configuration management system called [Zkybase](https://github.com/williewheeler/zkybase). It's a new project, and we're still working out a lot of the high-level vision for this thing. I'll post more information about it later, but for now I just wanted to post some screenshots as a way for people to see how it looks. We're using [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) for the CSS (very nice toolkit--love it), and Spring/[Neo4j](http://neo4j.org/) (along with [Spring Data Neo4j](http://www.springsource.org/spring-data/neo4j) on the backend. So far the Neo4j graph data is working out great for configuration management data.

Anyway here are the screenshots.

First, the dashboard:

Here's the project details page:

And here's the page that allows you to create a new project:
